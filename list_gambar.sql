In Indonesia, land certificates dictate the legal rights to a property. Checking the land certificate thoroughly will help the investor to avoid any sort of discrepancy that arises post-investing.</li>\r\n<li>2. Some properties have no road access, which sometimes becomes an expensive affair to build and/or get access to a neighbours land. Having an agreement with the neighbour before the building starts could avoid unnecessary expenses later on.</li>\r\n<li>3. There are 2 key terms investors need to familiarize themselves with &ndash; Zoning and Land Aspect. Zoning applies to a large area dictating how your land can be used as per the government rulings whereas the Land aspect applies to a single plot of land.</li>\r\n<li>4. Checking the lands zoning restrictions is very crucial as it dictates if you can run the intended activities in that zone. For instance, if the land is in a green zone you will not be able to build anything on it.</li>\r\n<li>5. Not understanding tax regulations for real estate and stating a lower price on documents can pose legal threats and even denial of transfer of title to the buyer.</li>\r\n<li>6. Buying a property without conducting due diligence is a risky business. It is always suggested to conduct due diligence in order to effectively mitigate risk or any issues</li>\r\n<li>7. Work with a real estate agent to assist you in the venture. Any accredited real estate agency will have done a document check prior to listing a property and can save investors time and money</li>\r\n<li>8.

Are you interested in breath-taking natural attractions, fairy-tale castles, interesting museums or amazing architecture or just great food and a bustling atmosphere? This will all depend on what your mood is. Germany surely has something for everyone.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to well-known sights and attractions, some parts of Germany are not as crowded with tourists. Nonetheless, that doesnt mean these attractions arent worth a visit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>1. VISIT CHRISTMAS MARKETS IN GERMANY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Christmas Markets originated in Germany, and the tradition dates to the Late Middle Ages. These festive street markets are usually held during the four weeks of Advent. You can enjoy the blaze of glittering lights, tall Christmas trees and festive music at Christmas markets in Germany. The Christmas market in Dresden (Striezelmarkt) is considered the oldest one, but other favourite Christkindl markets can be found in Cologne, near the Cologne Cathedral, in Nuremberg, Munich, in old towns along the Rhine and Danube and more.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Christmas markets usually feature various stalls and stands with mulled wine, local delicacies and gifts from all over the world. Expect a variety of musical performances, artists, jugglers and even carousels. It really is a magical experience that will awaken your Christmas spirit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. ATTEND OKTOBERFEST IN MUNICH, GERMANY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oktoberfest dates to 1810. It originated as a celebration of a royal wedding when Crown Prince Ludwig 1 of Bavaria married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Besides the wedding activities, the festival also included horse races, concerts and other performances. Today, Oktoberfest attracts more than 5 million visitors to Munich every year. And, although it is called Oktoberfest, it always begins in September. This two-week event starts with a parade, and its really an over-sized state fair.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Carnival rides are a big part of Oktoberfest. When it comes to the beverage, beer is king at places like the Hofbr&auml;uhaus, but there is also something for wine lovers. Snack on pretzels, bratwurst, and apple strudel along with lots of German beer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even on a cool fall day, locals and visitors enjoy the beach on the German island of R&uuml;gen. Photo by Janna Graber</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. EXPLORE THE ISLANDS IN GERMANY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Did you know there are many beautiful islands in Germany? Most are located off the northern coast, and they are mostly undiscovered by tourists. However, bigger islands R&uuml;gen in the Baltic and Sylt in the North Sea are popular island destinations in Germany.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These islands feature lovely beaches, butterfly sanctuaries and even Germanys smallest National Park, Jasmund. You can admire its chalk cliffs, or enjoy sailing and salty breezes on other islands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. VISIT BERLIN AND SEE THE REMAINS OF THE BERLIN WALL</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Germany was divided between East and West at the end of World War II, and then the Berlin wall was constructed in 1961. Its purpose was to stop people from fleeing communist East Germany for capitalist West Germany. It was protected with barbed wire, watchtowers and guards. The Brandenburg gate was also a part of the wall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The wall, almost 27 miles long, was torn down in 1989, marking the beginning of the end of the Cold War in Eastern Europe. But, you can still see its remains if you know where to look. East Side Gallery is the largest remaining part of the wall, and its covered with paintings created by artists from 21 countries back in 1990.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. GO HIKING AT GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN IN BAVARIA</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a small town in Bavaria, near Germanys highest mountain Zugspitze, which rises to 9,718 feet (2,962 meters).

You can go cycling and explore this stunning region on two wheels. And if this isnt enough, there are more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) of hiking trails as well as more than 100 trail running routes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>6. ATTEND A PERFORMANCE AT THE NATIONAL THEATER IN MUNICH, GERMANY</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The National Theatre is home to the Bavarian State Opera, founded more than 360 years ago. This opera house has an impressive exterior and magnificent interior. If you havent attended a live performance, this is a perfect place to experience one.

ENJOY A CONCERT IN HAMBURG AT THE ELBPHILHARMONIE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hamburg hopes that Elbphilharmonie will become an iconic symbol of the city. It remains to be seen whether its a success. This project was criticized for its cost and schedule overruns. However, the building nicknamed Elphi is said to be the largest and acoustically most advanced concert hall in the world. The grand structure stands on the Elbe River, and it can be seen from miles around.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>8. VISIT THE FAIRYTALE NEUSCHWANSTEIN CASTLE IN BAVARIA</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During your road trip in Bavaria, stop by Neuschwanstein Castle, which was the inspiration for Disneys iconic Cinderella Castle. It was the home of King Ludwig II. He grew up in the medieval knights castle but had always dreamed of building a castle on the rugged hill above the village.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This 19th-century palace is located at the southwest border of the German state of Bavaria. Although it can be visited only within guided tours for security reasons, this idyllic setting is well worth the visit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>9. VISIT A GERMAN BEER GARDEN</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Summers in German can be rainy. But as soon as the calendar hits late August, beer gardens wipe dries their benches and tables. Long tables, delicious beer and gorgeous settings make beer gardens destination-worthy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beer gardens date to the 19th century. Initially, they were extensions of German breweries. Today, there are many beer gardens across the country where you can enjoy a cold brew.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>10. VISIT TOP MUSEUMS LIKE THE DOCUMENTATION CENTER NAZI PARTY RALLY GROUNDS IN NUREMBERG</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Germany, there truly is a museum for everyone covering everything from computer games and a collection of creepy marionettes to preserved segments of the Berlin wall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Berlin, the five museums on the famous Museum Island present a panorama of art and history.

That means the 10 places that did end up on this list of Australias best destinations are seriously good. We promise.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>1. Sydney</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australias biggest city is most international visitors gateway into the country, and the sparkling Sydney Harbour provides a spectacular welcome mat. You cant miss Sydneys two iconic landmarks &ndash; the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House &ndash; but theres no doubt that the Harbour Citys main attraction is its gorgeous beaches, including Bondi and Coogee in the Eastern Suburbs and Manly on the Northern Beaches.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Melbourne</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The countrys second-largest metropolis cant match Sydneys sand or sunshine, but Melbourne makes up for it with coffee, culture, food and sport. The Victorian capital is Australias most cosmopolitan city, made up of moody laneways lined with urban art and hole-in-the-wall cafes, arty boutiques and galleries, a progressive dining scene, and sport. Lots and lots of sport.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Great Barrier Reef</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">See it while you still can. Climate change is bleaching the colour out of the worlds largest coral reef system, which stretches 2,300 kilometres along the sunny Queensland coast, but there are still plenty of dive sites where you can snorkel the warm water to see brilliant coral and amazing marine life. Visit the lush Daintree Rainforest, the remarkable Fraser Island and the serene Whitsunday Islands while youre in tropical North Queensland, too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. Uluru</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Words cant quite capture the majesty of The Rock, a hulking sandstone monolith that emerges out of the ochre-red dust of Central Australia. Uluru carries immense significance to Australias Indigenous people and is one of the countrys most iconic landmarks &ndash; take it in by foot, on the back of a horse or a Harley Davidson, from above in a helicopter or hot air balloon, or with a meal at dusk.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Adelaide</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The City of Churches really needs a new nickname that more accurately reflects the vibrant, dynamic place Adelaide has become in recent years. Maybe the city of year-round festivals, or the city of charismatic bars, cafes and restaurants that gives Melbourne a run for its money, or perhaps the city with dozens of wine regions on its doorstep, the perfect place to sample the world-class reds South Australia is famous for.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>6. Great Ocean Road</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spanning 243 kilometres of rugged Victorian coastline west of Melbourne, the Great Ocean Road is easily Australias most picturesque touring route, and perhaps one of the most scenic road trips on the face of the Earth. Schedule pit stops to marvel at the towering limestone stacks of the 12 Apostles, the postcard-perfect Loch Ard Gorge, and quaint coastal villages such as Port Fairy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>7. Byron Bay</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hippie haven, surfing mecca, celebrity hideaway, compulsory stop on the well-trodden backpacker trail up the East Coast &ndash; the most easterly point on the Australian mainland is many different things, including one of the countrys hottest tourist destinations. If you want to avoid the crowds and cost of Byron Bay itself, escape into the pristine hinterland, bliss out in the alternative lifestyle hub of Nimbin, or catch a wave down the road in Yamba.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>8. Hobart</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The capital of Tasmania &ndash; a leafy island state just south of the Australian mainland &ndash; has always been a pleasant place to visit, but Hobart has turned into a must-see destination for one reason and one reason only: MONA. Opened in a winery in 2011, the Museum of Old and New Art is Australias most exciting cultural experience thanks to a subterranean collection of subversive pieces that has to be seen to be believed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>9. Canberra</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australias capital gets a bad rap, mainly because its crawling with politicians. But visitors are treated to a compact city packed full of great attractions too often overlooked by tourists, including the engrossing Australian War Memorial, the modern National Arboretum, the array of museums including Questacon and the National Gallery, plus an exciting (and booming) food and drink scene.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>10. Rottnest Island</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An island paradise blessed with more than 60 white sand beaches, turquoise water and abundant marine life located just a half-hour ferry from Perth would be a popular enough destination &ndash; and thats before you add Australias cutest animal into the equation. The star attraction of Rotto is the resident population of quokkas, an adorable little animal that looks like a miniature kangaroo and isnt afraid to bounce up to admirers for a selfie.</p>', '2022-09-12 12:29:00', 'aktif'),

Check. Lush green forest tumbling down a cliff to a white-sand beach. Check. The sheltered inlet of &Ouml;l&uuml;deniz, just a short journey from Fethiye, is Turkeys most famous beach, and with scenery that might as well have fallen off a perfect postcard, its easy to see why its popularity hasnt waned.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the beach gets too crowded, its time to take to the skies and experience the stunning aerial views on a tandem paragliding dive off the summit of mighty Babadağ (Mount Baba), which rises up behind the shore.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Oh, did we mention that &Ouml;l&uuml;deniz is one of the worlds top paragliding destinations?

And if you want to hop between the Scottish cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, a one-hour train ride will deposit you in the heart of either city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>London: The UKs All-in-One Destination</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While its possible to plan a trip to the UK without visiting London, its certainly not to be advised. The nations sprawling capital boasts plenty of attractions to keep you busy. For those interested in learning more about the UKs rich history, one of the top things to do in London is visit the Tower of London. Located beside the spectacular Tower Bridge on the banks of the River Thames, this former palace and prison includes highlights such as the iconic 1,000-year-old White Tower, with its fascinating displays of armor and weaponry, and the Jewel House, home to the Crown Jewels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fans of Britains Royal Family will want to head to Buckingham Palace, Londons Royal home since Queen Victorias reign. Here, you can enjoy the colorful pomp of the Changing of the Guard or even take a tour of the Palaces State Rooms (be sure to book in advance as theyre only open for a few weeks each year).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The citys Whitehall Road area is another must, where youll find Big Ben and the Parliament Buildings, as well as Westminster Abbey, scene of many a royal wedding.

Also check out Trafalgar Square, home to iconic Nelsons Column and the National Portrait Gallery</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Roman-Era Bath</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although one of the UKs smaller cities, Bath more than makes up for its diminutive size with a multitude of things to see and do. Named after its famous Roman Baths, this beautiful city has been luring visitors to its healing waters for more than 2,000 years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gushing from three hot springs, the water-known to consist of 43 different minerals, hence its curative properties-travels upwards some 3,048 meters at a rate of 275,000 gallons per day, before spilling out at a consistent 46.5 degrees Celsius. While its not possible to bathe in the original Roman Baths, a number of nearby spas &ndash; most notably the superb Thermae Bath Spa &ndash; offer guests the chance to enjoy the citys famous waters.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to its ancient history, Bath is also famous for its lovely Georgian architecture.

A country full of beautiful nature, vibrant cities and cozy villages. A country where everyone is welcome and feels at home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amsterdam is probably the first stop on anyones trip to the Netherlands&mdash;and for good reason. But there is so much more to this small country (about one-third the size of Pennsylvania) than its capital city. Think rows of windmills, fields of tulips, and cities bursting with culture and charm. Luckily for you, its all just a short drive or train ride away from that main city hub. Heres a list to get you started</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Giethoorn</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Affectionately referred to as the &ldquo;Venice of the Netherlands&rdquo; this villages thatched roof farmhouses and wooden arch bridges can be explored via bike lanes or canals&mdash;either by boat, or by ice skating during the frozen winter months</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Beemster Polder</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">About thirteen miles north of Amsterdam, the Beemster region is an example of a Dutch polder&mdash;a flat piece of green farmland formed by draining a body of water. Aside from its cultural significance (it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999), Beemster Polder is a gorgeous landscape, complete with little canals, windmills, and lush, green fields. Make sure to stop by Middenbeemster, which, like most towns in the country, is impossibly charming.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Utrecht</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The canals of Utrecht have two stories, where centuries-old wharf cellars now serve as spots to enjoy food and drinks at water level&mdash;something unique to this city. You can also enjoy the towering churches and cozy cafes of Utrecht via cycling, as its one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world. Its also the perfect place for history buffs, with sites like the Dom Tower and Centraal Museum offering glimpses into the countrys past.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">De Hoge Veluwe National Park</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This park is one of the largest in Holland, and within its 13,343 acres, counts rare wildlife, some of the most iconic buildings in the Netherlands, and the Kr&ouml;ller-M&uuml;ller museum, which showcases a collection of nineteenth and twentieth century art in addition to the largest private collection of Van Goghs. Zoom around on a (free) white bike&mdash;the park has 1,800 available for rent</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Texel Island</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Texel is the largest and most populated of the West Frisian Islands, also known as the Wadden Islands, due to their location in the Wadden Sea. The island offers landscapes unlike anything else on the mainland, including sweeping sand dunes, salt marshes filled with lavender, and beaches lined with bungalows.</p>', '2022-09-12 13:02:00', 'aktif'),

See Dubais Famed Cityscape at Burj Khalifa</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dubais landmark building and major tourist attraction is the Burj Khalifa, which at 829.8 meters is the tallest building in the world and the most famous of the citys points of interest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For most visitors, a trip to the observation deck on the 124th floor here is a must-do while in the city. The views across the city skyline from this birds-eye perspective are simply staggering.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The slick observation deck experience includes a multimedia presentation on both Dubai and the building of the Burj Khalifa (completed in 2010) before a high-speed elevator whizzes you up to the observation deck for those 360-degree views out across the skyscrapers to the desert on one side and the ocean on the other.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nighttime visits are particularly popular with photographers due to Dubais famous city-lights panoramas.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Back on the ground, wrapping around the Burj Khalifa, are the gardens of Burj Park, with walkways dotted with modern art sculptures.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Burj Park is where you come to see the Dubai Fountain display on Burj Lake. Modeled on the famous Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas, this is the worlds tallest performing fountain, with water displays shooting up to 150 meters high into the air.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Visit an Underwater World at Dubai Aquarium</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the citys top tourist attractions, the Dubai Aquarium houses 140 species of sea life in the huge suspended tank on the ground floor of the Dubai Mall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although there is free viewing from the mall, the highlight of a visit here is entering the Underwater Zoo, with its three-story high, 270-degree views along the length of the glass-panel tunnels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As well as viewing the vast amount of marine life, the Dubai Aquarium offers plenty of aquatic experiences and things to do for visitors who want a close-up encounter with some of the aquariums inhabitants, from hand-feeding eagle rays to diving with reef and tiger sharks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Soak Up the Sun at JBR (Jumeirah Beach Residence) Beach</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some of Dubais most popular beach resorts are strung out all along its length, making this one of the most popular places to stay for visitors who want to make hitting the beach a major part of their Dubai stay.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The large public areas of the beach have excellent facilities, with plenty of sun loungers, restaurants, lifeguards patrolling the stretches designated for swimming, and water sports operators offering jet skiing, kayak rental, parasailing, and boat rides.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is a safe beach choice for families traveling with tots, as the turquoise water of the Gulf lapping the shore is shallow and calm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. Head Out into the Desert</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You dont have to travel far from Dubais coastal skyline of skyscrapers to reach some of the UAEs desertscapes of rippling dunes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both the dune fields and desert of the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve and the orange-hued dunes of Maleha (actually in the Emirate of Sharjah) are within day-tripping distance of the city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Desert adventure tours can combine a range of activities, from sandboarding, camel rides, and 4WD safaris to traditional Arabian falconry displays and desert dinners under the stars. There are also options for overnight camping under the stars.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The typical tour itinerary, giving visitors a taster of desert life, is easily slotted into even a short trip to Dubai, taking around six hours door to door, with a mid-afternoon departure from the city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Dubai Desert 4x4 Safari offers a half-day desert adventure and includes a camel ride, sandboarding lessons, a sunset barbecue, and a belly dancing show.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For a less rushed tour experience, choose one of the companies that operate inside the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, where trips can include wildlife drives to spot the reserves free-roaming herds of gazelles and, if youre lucky, Arabian oryx.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Walk through History in Al Fahidi Quarter (Old Dubai)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Al Fahidi Quarter (previously known, and sometimes still referred to as the Bastakia neighborhood) was built in the late 19th century to be the home of wealthy Persian merchants who dealt mainly in pearls and textiles and were lured to Dubai because of the tax-free trading and access to Dubai Creek.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Al Fahidi occupies the eastern portion of Bur Dubai along the creek, and the coral and limestone buildings here, many with walls topped with wind-towers, have been excellently preserved.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wind-towers provided the homes here with an early form of air conditioning - the wind trapped in the towers was funneled down into the houses. Persian merchants likely transplanted this architectural element (common in Iranian coastal houses) from their home country to the Gulf.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lined with distinct Arabian architecture, the narrow lanes are highly evocative of a bygone, and much slower, age in Dubais history.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inside the district, youll find the Majlis Gallery, with its collection of traditional Arab ceramics and furniture (housed in a wind-tower), and the Al Serkal Cultural Foundation with a shop, caf&eacute;, and rotating art exhibitions (located in one of the historic buildings).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>6. Ski then Shop at Mall of the Emirates</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mall of the Emirates is one of the citys most famous malls, with the spectacular (and surreal) Ski Dubai facility inside.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The indoor ski slope is complete with chairlifts and a penguin enclosure, all at a continuous temperature of -4 degrees Celsius.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Theres also a cinema complex and a family entertainment center with a whole host of rides aimed at both the big and small.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The shopping opportunities are boundless, as are the eating options, offering every conceivable world cuisine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>7. Snap Sunset Pics at Dubai Frame</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sitting slap-bang between Dubais older neighborhoods clustered around the creek and the citys modern sprawl, this ginormous 150-meter-high picture frame is one of Dubais latest sights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inside, a series of galleries whisk you through the citys history and explore Emirati heritage before you travel up to the Sky Deck, where there are fantastic panoramas of both old and new Dubai to be snapped on the viewing platforms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Afterwards check out Future Dubai gallery, which imagines what a futuristic vision of the city will look like.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>8. Take to the Water at Kite Beach &amp; Umm Suqeim Beach</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks to its surf and prevailing wind, the northern section of Umm Suqeim Beach is Dubais top spot for kitesurfing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The beach is home to an array of water sports operators offering equipment hire, as well as kitesurfing lessons, along with paddleboarding and kayak rental.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This long stretch of yellow-sand beach sweeps south along the coast (becoming Umm Suqeim Beach), with plenty of space for sunbathers looking to lap up a lazy day of swimming and soaking up the rays on the sand and excellent facilities and dining choices. There are good views of the Burj Al Arab from the southern end of the beach.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While in the Jumeirah area, its well worth brushing off the sand for an hour to visit the Majlis Ghorfat Um Al-Sheef just a three-kilometer hop from the beach. Built in 1955, this was the summer residence of the late Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The residence, made out of gypsum and coral-block, has been restored and maintains much of the original beautiful decor, giving you a better understanding of the opulent lifestyle of Dubais rulers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Majlis Gardens feature a reproduction of an impressive Arab irrigation system, and many shady date palms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>9. Explore Dubai Creek</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dubai Creek separates the city into two towns, with Deira to the north and Bur Dubai to the south.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The creek has been an influential element in the citys growth, first attracting settlers here to fish and pearl dive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Small villages grew up alongside the creek as far back as 4,000 years ago, while the modern era began in the 1830s when the Bani Yas tribe settled in the area.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The creek is where you come to capture city views from the water, either by taking a trip on one of the many dhows that have been restored as tourist cruise boats or by hopping on an abra (small wooden ferry) between the ferry points on the creeks Bur Dubai and Deira banks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the Bur Dubai side of the creek, rubbing up against the Bastakia neighborhood, the waterfront has been regenerated as the Al Seef district, with a waterfront promenade backed by traditional coral-block and limestone buildings, a floating market, and shops selling crafts. Its a great place for a stroll with excellent water views.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Farther southeast down the creek, on the Deira bank just north of Al-Maktoum Bridge, is the Dhow Wharfage. Its still used by small traders from across the Gulf who sail their dhows onward to Kuwait, Iran, Oman, India, and down to Africas horn.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This tiny remnant of Dubais traditional economy is a fascinating place to wander around and watch cargo being loaded and unloaded on and off the dhows.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the southeastern end of Dubai Creek, just before the creek joins with Dubai Canal, is the newly developed Dubai Creek Harbor with a waterfront marina walkway, which offers excellent vistas of the city skyline.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>10. Skydive over Dubai</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the ultimate sightseeing adrenaline rush while youre in the city, tandem-skydive over Dubai from Skydive Dubais Palm Drop Zone.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are birds-eye views of the citys skyscraper coastline, Dubai Marina, and the artificial islands of Palm Jumeirah, all the way down the 3,900-meter-high plunge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The entire experience takes around 90 minutes and includes the flight; an instructor youll be harnessed to during the skydive; and a skydiving camera operator, wholl take pictures during your dive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you prefer desert dune scenery, Skydive Dubai also operates a separate tandem-skydiving experience in the desert, about 35 kilometers out of the city.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Skydiving in Dubai is an activity you need to book as far in advance as possible due to limited numbers and the high popularity of the experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '2022-09-12 14:00:00', 'aktif');

Balinese women have covered themselves while some lived topless until the 1980s. A law regulates cockfighting, which is now prohibited except on rare occasions. Cities have developed on the seaside, close to the demons that they were once far from...</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are, however, only slight adjustments, if we compare them to the thousand-year-old traditions that continue to permeate Balinese society.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is our selection of eight surprising Bali traditions:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1 - Giving the same first name to almost everyone:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the Sudra caste, formerly the peasants, which represents 90% of the population in Bali, the first child of the family is given the name Wayan, Gede or Putu. Girl or boy, it doesnt matter. No choice for the second one either, he is called Made, Kadek or Nengah. The third is Nyoman or Komang, and the fourth is Ketut. And if a fifth child is born... we start over with the first! The sixth child will be named the second and so on.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To complicate matters, the Balinese dont have a last name. Instead, they have a name chosen by the parents, usually based on the character or physique of the child at birth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2 - Dressing the trees</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If youve ever come to Bali before you will surely have noticed that some of the trees were dressed in a cloth skirt. The same black and white checkered fabric that surrounds some statues in the temples of Bali.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dressing The Tree</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We inquired about these trees more modest than the others. They are the ones that the Balinese think are inhabited by an invisible spirit. They are most often banians, a species considered sacred in the Hindu religion, but sometimes other trees, even large stones.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Concerning the banyan, this tree has a rather original technique to grow. Its branches let long roots hang down which grows towards the ground and as soon as a root reaches the ground, it consolidates to become a new trunk. It is not a new tree, just a new trunk for the same tree. To prevent banyan, even sacred ones, from becoming too invasive, the Balinese watch the roots and apply a small chisel stroke as they approach the ground.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/dressing-the-tree-300x135.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"135\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3- Wobble abruptly and irregularly the body of a deceased in all directions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">During a funeral ceremony in Bali, the coffin is placed in a bamboo tower and driven to the cremation site by numerous bearers, between ten and forty depending on the popularity of the deceased. But there is no time for meditation in the procession. On the contrary, the porters will do their utmost to shake and jolt the tower.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wobble Abruptly</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aim is to distract and disorient the spirit of the deceased to prevent him from finding his way back and haunting his village and his home. The most effective technique seems to be to turn once or twice on the spot at each crossroads so that he no longer knows where the convoy is coming from!</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Wobble-abruptly-300x166.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4- Dropping off cigarettes and banknotes as an offering</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you walk through the streets during your holiday in Bali, you will have the opportunity to see many small offerings arranged everywhere. Made of leaves and filled with flowers, food, and incense, these small baskets are scattered all over the island and became a symbol of Bali.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dropping of Cigarettes</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the island of the gods, the offerings are part of the daily life of the Balinese. The Balinese deposit offerings every day either to thank the gods (the offerings are placed on top) or to appease the demons (in this case they are placed on the ground). We already found it strange that the Balinese put sweets in their plastic wrappings, but we were even more surprised the first time we saw a cigarette in the little basket. Either the Balinese do not know that smoking is harmful, or, more likely, the gods are immortal. We also saw banknotes in offerings, especially in the temples. What do the gods buy with them? No idea, we are in search of an explanation! R&eacute;vis&eacute;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/canang-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5- Respecting the Nyepi: The Day of Silence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Bali, Nyepi is the most important and unusual festival of the year! These festivities, unique in the world, celebrate the passage to the New Year, we are currently in 1941 of the Hindu Saka calendars.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nyepi begins to make its approach about a month before the fateful date, the streets are then populated with monsters being made with paper-m&acirc;ch&eacute; they call them the Ogoh Ogoh. Once finished, they will be used to frighten and repel the evil spirits that try to invade the earth every new year. A few days before Nyepi the religious ceremonies, already extremely numerous in Bali, are multiplying, on the beaches on the occasion of Melasti. The island begins to slow down. The monsters are now almost all finished, and they haunt the streets of every Balinese village with their impressive presence. The Ogoh Ogoh are then carried along the streets by men, making several turns on themselves at each crossing to lose the evil geniuses. Many torches are lit, and firecrackers explode more beautifully. After two or three intense hours, the Balinese will defeat their immaterial assailants who will then slowly ascend towards the sky. This year the Nyepi will be celebrated on the 25th March, the Day of Silence. On this day, the demons make a big raid on the island. Never short of parades, the Balinese keep quiet at home for twenty-four hours and everything is done to make people think that the island is deserted, uninhabited, in short, of no interest to the demons. Its all the activity on the island of Bali that goes into a pause, the televisions and even the lights stay off. The airport is closed, and no flights are scheduled to enter or leave the territory. It is officially forbidden to go out in the streets, including for non-Hindus and tourists. Police patrols are on the lookout and they are not joking at all. The only exception to this rule is ambulances in urgent medical cases such as childbirth, seizures or heart attacks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-day-of-silence-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6- Omed-Omedan: The kissing ritual</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The day after Nyepi in the Banjar Kaja in the village of Sesetan, Denpasar. There is a tradition of the omed-omedan which is a wet kissing ritual to celebrate the joy of the first day of the Balinese New Year. The people of this village believe that if this ceremony does not take place there will be a disaster.This tradition has been going on for a hundred years and does not exist anywhere else than in Bali. Before it begins the participants of the omed-omedan go to pray at the Banjar temple. Once the prayer is done there is a small barong dance performance that takes place in the street. By this time hundreds of people have already gathered to attend the event. The ritual of omed-omedan starts around 2 pm. If you want to observe these festivities, you better come early to make sure you have a good place to watch and take pictures. By the way, a little advice: protect your camera because there will be water \"flying\"! Only members of the Banjar of this village and single people between 17 and 30 years old can take part in this ceremony. The single young people of the village meet in the street separated into 2 groups: girls on one side, boys on the other facing each other. At the signal of the priest and the music, they rush to the center and the boys try to catch the girls to steal a kiss from them while the members of the crowd spray them with water. Only the brave ones manage to get a kiss on the lips while the others get a kiss on the cheek. The water used during the ceremony is supposed to represent fertility. Be aware that Indonesians are modest so the participants, especially the women are a little embarrassed while the men will be rather playful. Some participants will even become couples as a result of this event, and many will get married.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/omed-omedan-300x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7 - Tumpek Landep: Thanking your metal objects on the Metal Day</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Less constraining than the Day of Silence, the metal festival is celebrated every year by the Balinese.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tradition of this festival, born in a distant time when the Balinese owned only a few metal objects, is much more demonstrative than today. Everybody polishes and takes great care of their scooter, car, cooking and gardening utensils... before depositing a mess of offerings. The aim is to thank the objects for their help, in the hope that they will continue to bring luck to their owner and that they will not betray them for another year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tumpek-landep-300x159.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"159\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>8 - Getting your teeth filed</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Put your finger on your canines. Can you feel how they stick out compared to the other teeth? Well, the Balinese dont have that problem. Every teenager, boy or girl, has to go through the coming of age ritual of having their canines filed. At a party organized for the occasion, a Brahmin gives a few strokes of the file on the protruding teeth... without anesthesia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While this may be the secret of beautiful Balinese smiles, this ritual has a deeper meaning. The sharp teeth represent the beastly side of humanity. By removing them, the child becomes a wise and responsible adult, who will not be dominated by anger, jealousy or other vile instincts. Usually, the ceremony is done just before a wedding.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/teeth-filed-300x211.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you know other fun Balinese traditions dont hesitate to share them with us!</p>', '2022-09-12 14:06:00', 'aktif'),
(47, 'img/588949771968blog15.jpg', 'What is Appraisal?', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The real estate market in Bali is not stable, it goes through periods of ups and downs due to several factors such as environmental crises. Everyday lease periods are expiring, so appraisal becomes necessary and crucial in such a constantly changing environment. The valuation is used, in these examples, to renegotiate the price of the new leasehold contract. In Bali, many real estate projects are being developed on a regular basis, offering luxury apartments, villas and hotels with European standards.You can buy a beautiful Balinese house of 100 m&sup2; living space in a tropical garden with its swimming pool in the heart of the rice fields for 130 000 $. The market for villa rentals is flourishing. The quality of the service and the low cost of labor allow to offer high level services at very affordable costs. In this article we will introduce you the essential notions of appraisal if you are interested in investing in Bali or want to sell a property or start a business in Bali.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Valuation of Property</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The valuation of a property is a crucial step to define the right value of a property. It is not in the sellers interest to over or undervalue the property. In order to set the \"right price\", it is necessary to evaluate a number of points objectively.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The influence of the environment in the valuation of a property</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2851-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Within the same city, we can observe differences between neighborhoods but also from one street to another. The environment, the attractiveness of the area, the notoriety of the district, the presence of local shops, good schools, the feeling of security, the prospects for development of the territory. All these elements have an influence on the selling price and will therefore be taken into account in the valuation of your property. Some defects are expensive, the characteristics of the dwelling and the property also have an influence on the selling price In order to carry out the valuation of a property, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the property allows a price to be determined per square meter. In general, the starting point is the average price of the property, which is weighted according to the propertys strengths and weaknesses</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The determination of a \"fair price\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"http://www.bvrproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/31-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the one hand, the buyer wants to get \"a good deal\". On the other hand, the owner wants to sell at the \"best price\". But what is a good price? For the seller, it is often above the market price. The owner, who has an emotional relationship with his home, tends to lose objectivity. He is all the more biased as he generally wishes to realize a capital gain. For the buyer, the \"best price\" will, on the other hand, be below market rates. In fact, he will tend to look at the slightest defects to better negotiate the purchase price. Between the two estimates, there is the \"right price\". The one that allows you to sell a home within the average time frame.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The determination of a fair price</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Appraisal to get bank loans (for locals only)</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sooner or later, youll probably need a bank loan to help you finance your dream home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What are the main Valuation Methods for assets and businesses?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All the strengths and weaknesses of your business are used as a basis for its valuation, which in turn is the basis for negotiations with the potential investors. But keep in mind that valuation is about assessing the value of your business, not about setting the selling price! To estimate the value of your business, there are different approaches: market approach, future income approach. And of course, you can combine several of them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Market Approach</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It aims to put your company in perspective with others, with as close a profile as possible, and with a known transaction value. These methods are particularly suitable for business transfers for which there is an official listing. Certain craft trades or certain businesses thus have useful statistics for a \"market\" approach to the value of the business, collected in scales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Comparative methods are more or less a reflection of the results of other methods, as applied by the market of comparable transactions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Income Approach</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To estimate the businesss future ability to generate profits, and then to deduct its value, taking into account the risk of not realizing these benefits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These methods have the advantage that they can be used both by the seller, based on the history that you can project into the future, and by the buyer, based on the expected future profitability of the business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You will thus be able to compare the valuation of the business (and therefore the proceeds of its sale or the financing mobilized to acquire it) with its projected profitability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cost Approach</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The cost approach considers the price of the asset as the value of its constituent parts, the value of the underlying land and the amortized value of the upgrades that has been done on the property.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The cost method is founded on the economic conviction that well-informed buyers will not pay more than the cost of producing a good than the actual cost of producing a similar good with the same level of utility. The cost approach is easier to use when the asset is new and has the highest and best rate of use.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Assets and business evaluations are also appraisal</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A real estate or business appraisal must be done objectively, without emotional attachment and without pecuniary interest. Using an appraiser recognized by the Indonesian Society of Appraisal (MAPPI) or an appraiser who is a member of a professional association in the field of real estate appraisal ensures an impartial and neutral opinion on your property or business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Using an Appraisal Member of the MAPPI:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guarantees their technical competence</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Guides their work by setting standards for evaluation methods and techniques and the nature, content and manner of reporting.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Certifies that they have professional liability insurance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The appraisers agree on the coupled use of several methods in order to obtain not an average price but rather a multifaceted view of a company or a property, in order to prepare the price negotiation for either the leasehold, freehold or rental contract.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you search a competent appraiser or just want to learn more about appraisal you can visit our website</p>', '2022-09-12 14:07:00', 'aktif'),
